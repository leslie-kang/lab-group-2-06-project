# Proposal 1: Scrabble Data
We retrieved this data from fivethirtyeight.com under an article called "How
‘Qi’ And ‘Za’ Changed Scrabble." The author of this article, Oliver Roeder,
collected this data by web-scraping 1,542,642 tournament games between
1973 and 2017 from cross-tables.com. This data set contains 19 variables, with a
few that may be of interest.
We may look at `winnerid` (the numerical ID of the winning player),
`winnerscore` (score of winning player), `date`, and `lexicon` (a binary
variable indicating whether the game was played with the North American lexicon
or not).
*Please note that the data set is big and we were not able to upload it into our
`data/` folder. We have communicated this with Professor Smith.
\
There were two major dictionary changes that took place between 1972 and 2017.
What we want to know: Which edition of the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary
or OSPD had the greater influence on increasing average winning score, edition
4 or edition 5 of OSPD?
\
$H_0: \mu_4 - \mu_1 = \mu_5 - \mu_2$
\
$H_A: \mu_4 - \mu_1 > \mu_5 - \mu_2$
\
Where $\mu_4$ = 3 year average winning score after 4th edition publication,
$\mu_1$ = 3 year average winning score before 4th edition publication, $\mu_5$ =
3 year average winning score after 5th edition publication, $\mu_2$ = 3 year
average winning score before 5th edition publication.
