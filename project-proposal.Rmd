# Proposal 1: Scrabble Data
We retrieved this data from fivethirtyeight.com under an article called "How
‘Qi’ And ‘Za’ Changed Scrabble." The author of this article, Oliver Roeder,
collected this data by web-scraping 1,542,642 tournament games between
1973 and 2017 from cross-tables.com. This data set contains 19 variables, with a
few that may be of interest.
We may look at `winnerid` (the numerical ID of the winning player),
`winnerscore` (score of winning player), `date`, and `lexicon` (a binary
variable indicating whether the game was played with the North American lexicon
or not).
*Please note that the data set is big and we were not able to upload it into our
`data/` folder. We have communicated this with Professor Smith.
\
There were two major dictionary changes that took place between 1972 and 2017.
What we want to know: Which edition of the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary
or OSPD had the greater influence on increasing average winning score, edition
4 or edition 5 of OSPD?
\
$H_0: \mu_4 - \mu_1 = \mu_5 - \mu_2$
\
$H_A: \mu_4 - \mu_1 > \mu_5 - \mu_2$
\
Where $\mu_4$ = 3 year average winning score after 4th edition publication,
$\mu_1$ = 3 year average winning score before 4th edition publication, $\mu_5$ =
3 year average winning score after 5th edition publication, $\mu_2$ = 3 year
average winning score before 5th edition publication.

# Proposal 2

We retrieved these data from fivethirtyeight.com under an article called
"The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women." The data
includes one csv file pulled from an API on the Bechdel Test website and another
file with various movie statistics pulled from IMDb. The former is a score named 
after the famous cartoonist Allison Bechdel according the following criteria:
`0` = unscored, `1.` It has to have at least two [named] women in it, 
`2.` Who talk to each other, `3.` About something besides a man. 

This 'test' was created to determine whether a movie's female characters were
permitted any depth--something, for myriad reasons, that's still unlikely. 
The IMDb datasetmwill be used to look at the relationship between a movie's 
gender for `director` and `writer`. We hypothesize that the presence of a 
female writer and/or director increases the likelihood that a given film passes 
the Bechdel test.

$H_0: p_f = p_m$
\
$H_A: p_f > p_m$

Where $p_f$ is the proportion of movies with a female director and/or writer
that passes the Bechdel test and $p_m$ is the proportion of movies with a male 
director and writer that passes the Bechdel test.
